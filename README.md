# Shark Attacks Project

### Objectives
- Examine the [Shark Attacks dataset](https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm) and understand its structure. Formulate one or more hypotheses about the data.

- Use data wrangling techniques to clean messy data set (handle missing values and duplicates, standardize inconsistent data within columns)

- Once the dataset is cleaned, conduct basic exploratory data analysis to validate initial hypotheses and derive meaningful insights.

### Files
- The notebook [Shark_attack_cleaning_EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/Beata2307/Shark_Attack/blob/main/Shark_attack_cleaning_EDA.ipynb) includes functions for cleaning the dataset, with each function handling different column-related issues, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- The "data/" directory contains both the initial and cleaned datasets.
- In-depth information regarding data cleaning, identified issues, and business problem statements can be found in the [presentation](https://github.com/Beata2307/Shark_Attack/blob/main/Shark_attack_presentation.pdf).
